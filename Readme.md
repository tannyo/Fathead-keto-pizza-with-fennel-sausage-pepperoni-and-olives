# Fathead keto (low carb) pizza with fennel sausage, pepperoni, and olives.

## Crust Ingredients:

- 1 1/2 cups whole milk shredded mozzarella cheese (168g by weight)
- 1 oz cream cheese (cubed) (28g by weight)
- ¾ cup almond flour  (84g by weight)
- 1 large egg
- Garlic powder 
- Oregano or Italian Seasoning

## Topping Ingredients:

- Trader Joe’s Pizza sauce or favorite marinara sauce (Rao’s is good).
- Fennel sausage 
- Pepperoni 
- 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese (whatever you think looks nice)
- Black olives (sliced)

## Equipment:

- Wooden spoon
- Parchment paper
- Cookie sheet
- Fork
- Oven

## Instructions:
### Crust 
1. Heat oven to 425° F. 
2. Put  mozzarella & cream cheese in a medium size microwaveable bowl.
3. Microwave for 1 min, stir with wooden spoon and then microwave another 30 sec, stir (very hot!). 
4. Quickly stir in with wooden spoon almond flour then egg.
5. Add Garlic powder, Oregano or Italian Seasoning and stir. 
6. Wet hands and spread dough into circle on parchment paper. You may have to wet your hands several times. It should spread evenly with dough-like consistency (if stringy then your cheese has hardened too much, just put it back in the microwave for 20 seconds).
7. Dock (poke rows of holes) with a fork to avoid bubbling.
8. Put in 425 degree oven.
9. After 8 minutes, check and poke holes with fork in any large bubbles.
10. Continue cooking for a total 12-14 minutes or until slightly brown on top.

### Toppings 
1. While crust is cooking, cook fennel sausage.
2. When crust is done use a fork to thinly spread pizza sauce on crust.
3. Sprinkle half the cheese on crust.
4. Add pepperoni, fennel sausage, and olive slices.
5. Sprinkle rest of cheese on top of pizza.
6. Return pizza to oven and continue to bake for approximately 8 minutes until cheese starts to show a few brown spots. May take longer if you use more cheese.
If crust starts to brown too much, cover edge of crust with aluminum foil or pie crust shield. This only happens if you use a lot of cheese.
7. When done, remove from oven and cut with pizza cutter or large chef’s knife.

## Notes:

You’ll be surprised that it takes very few pieces to get full with this pizza. I can usually eat no more than two pieces.

No need to use a fork and knife to eat the pizza as it holds up just like a regular dough crust pizza.

You can use any toppings you want just as long as you cook the raw toppings first. When you put the crust with toppings back in the oven you’re melting the cheese and warming the toppings, not cooking the toppings.

You can use more cheese, it’s up to you. For the topping I sometimes mix fontina in with the mozzarella.

It’s very important to use whole milk (highest fat content you can get) mozzarella cheese.

When applying the pizza sauce it is important to not use too much. If you use too much pizza sauce the toppings will slide off the cooked pizza. I suggest using a fork to apply the pizza sauce so that you can see the crust in between the ridges.
